\section*{Abstract}
I am a software developer with passion for challenging projects, which involve complex distributed systems, algorithms, high load, big data. My main specialization is development of complex backend systems. I mostly worked with Java and its ecosystem, but I am open and keen to learn new technologies if they better suit the project needs. I have a CS bachelor's degree from Faculty of Computer Network and Systems of BSUIR and CS degree from Yandex school of data analysis.

Mintdata started as a consulting company back in 2012, but grown into product company during the next years. I have participated in external projects and in development of internal products as well. I worked at MintData as backend engineer. But due to quite small team I gained lots of experience in different fields: architecture, planning, frontend development, DevOps, communication with customers.

Platform includes a big tool set to build applications, run and deploy them, control performance and execution process. I was responsible for: remote code execution and monitoring, production infrastructure, messaging protocols, REST services.\\
Key words: Java 8, RabbitMQ, Jersey, ElasticSearch, MySQL, Spring for DI, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform.

\paragraph{Greenwave IoT platform} During 1 year project duration, our team developed a cloud services which handled indications from millions of sensors, allow users to control their devices and create complex scenarios for them. We were a part of distributed team, with colleagues in USA, Switzerland, Singapore. At the end of the project I have performed 2 week on-site training of colleagues in Singapore.\\
Key technologies: Java 8, Kafka, Cassandra, ZooKeeper, XMPP, Mesos, Docker, Makefile.

\paragraph{Motifinvesting} This is a financial project, that allows users to spend their money on creation of investment profiles, which distribute their money in different proportions between different stocks. We have developed a module responsible for observation of market situation and notification of users in case of significant events like price change of their investement profiles.\\
