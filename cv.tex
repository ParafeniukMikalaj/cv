\section*{Abstract}
I am a software developer with passion for challenging projects, which involve complex distributed systems, big data, high load, machine learning, algorithms. My main specialization is development of complex backend systems. As I have started programming in 2009 when I was a freshman in university, I also have experience with web and Android development. In 2014 I received CS bachelors degree from Faculty of Computer Network and Systems of BSUIR and CS degree from Yandex school of data analysis. I can't say, that I prefer any technology or programming language in all situations. I use any technology depending on project needs I am working with, but I have great experience with Java and its ecosystem.

\section*{Work experience}

\subsection*{Mintdata. Since November 2014}
I worked at MintData as backend engineer. But due to processes particularity I gained lots of experience in different fields: architecture, planning, frontend development, DevOps, communication with customers.

\subsubsection*{Projects:}
\paragraph{Mintdata platform} This project started as an alternative to Apache Storm. Platform was used for different kind of tasks: web crawling, ETL, IoT, operational data analysis. Platform includes a big tool set to build applications, run and deploy them, control performance and execution process.\\
Key technologies: Java, RabbitMQ, Jersey, ElasticSearch, MySQL, Spring for DI, AWS.

\paragraph{Greenwave Systems} This was an IoT project, which lasted for one year. Our team developed a cloud services which handle indications from millions of sensors, allow users to control their devices and create complex scenarios for them. We were a part of distributed team, with colleagues in USA, Switzerland, Singapore. At the end of the project I have performed 2 week on-site training of colleagues in Singapore.\\
Key technologies: Java, Kafka, Cassandra, ZooKeeper, XMPP, Mesos, Docker, Makefile.

\paragraph{Motifinvesting} This is a financial project, that allows users to spend their money on creation of investment profiles, which distribute their money in different proportions between different stocks. We have developed a module responsible for observation of market situation and notification of users in case of significant events like price change of their investement profiles.\\
Key technologies: Apache Storm, Thomson Reuters, Quotemedia, MySQL, ZooKeeper, Hazelcast.

\paragraph{Loup} This was a killer of Uber, which had a premium class cars, which run on specified routes. The challenge was to rewrite system completely.\\
Key technologies: Android, Node.js.


\subsection*{Yandex. June 2013 - November 2014}\\\\
I worked at Yandex as Android developer. I have developed common authorization and registration module for all mobile applications. As Yandex has dozens of mobile development teams, I was required to solve complex backward compatibility and synchronization problems and to provide comprehensive documentation for other teams.\\
Key technologies: Android.

\subsection*{Omegasoftware January 2012 – June 2013}
I worked at OmegaSoftware as Web developer. I have created a number of different web sites: site for media company for improvement of advertising planning, site for corporate networks in Germany, site for russian community of builders.\\
Key technologies: Java, Play, Spring, MySQL, Asp.Net, MS SQL, Windows Azure, DevExpress, Oracle DB, Javascript, jQuery, ExtJs.

\subsection*{AndersenSoft July 2011 – December 2011}
I have worked at AndersenSoft as Android developer on audiobooks application.

\section*{Education}
\paragraph{BSUIR 2009-2014} bachelors CS degree. University gave me strong math and programming background. At university I developed several interesting projects like cross-platform guitar tuner, RSA implementation, 1000 card game for Android, several sites and lots of programming assignments.
\paragraph{Yandex school of data analysis 2012-2014} CS degree. This school improved my math and algorithms knowledge and gave me an opportunity to work with machine learning, natural language processing, parallel programming. There I completed a lot of interesting tasks: statistical translator, machine learning competitions at kaggle, lamdas on C++03, named entity recognition, OpenMP, MPI, Wikipedia Page Rank on MapReduce and a lot of others.

\section*{Technical skills}

\paragraph{Professional interests} Distributed systems, algorithms, machine learning, natural language processing, big data, high load, concurrency, networks.
\paragraph{Languages} English - B2. German - A2.
\paragraph{Programming languages} Primary: Java. Secondary: Python, C\#, C++, C, Javascript. Have experience: Delphi, Groovy, Scala.
\paragraph{Frameworks and libraries} Java world: Netty, Zookeeper, Grizzly, Hadoop, Kafka, Spark, Cassandra, Spring, Hibernate, Tomcat and others. Different languages: ELK, RabbitMQ. .NET: ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, DevExpress.
\paragraph{VCS} Primary: Git. Secondary: Mercurial, SVN.
\paragraph{IDE} IntelliJ Idea, Eclipse, VisualStudio, Android Studio, Emacs, Vim.
\paragraph{OS} Linux, Windows, MAC OS.
